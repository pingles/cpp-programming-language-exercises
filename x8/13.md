## Pointers or indexing?

> Run some tests to see if your compiler really generates equivalent code for iteration using pointers and iteration using indexing

Timed output from `13.cc`- performs 100,000 calls to `count_pairs` and writes to stdout. The data show that iterating throught the character array via points is faster than iterating through a `std::string` via its index operator.

All timings below captured via `std::chrono::high_resolution_clock` in nanoseconds.

Compiled with `-O3` the results between character arrays via index and pointer were mostly identical:

```
Pointer
Min.   :   26.00  
1st Qu.:   37.00  
Median :   38.00  
Mean   :   40.82  
3rd Qu.:   42.00  
Max.   :16695.00 
```

```
Indexer   
Min.   :   26.00  
1st Qu.:   38.00  
Median :   39.00  
Mean   :   40.76  
3rd Qu.:   41.00  
Max.   :20072.00 
```

The disassembly of the two procedures yields the same machine code so the compiler produces the same output when accessing via index and pointer. 

Iteration via `string::operator[]` was the slowest (between 20% and 60% slower than the previous times):

```
Min.   :   41.00  
1st Qu.:   43.00  
Median :   46.00  
Mean   :   49.37  
3rd Qu.:   49.00  
Max.   :20094.00 
```

Max in all was roughly equivalent suggesting something unrelated to the process affecting timing.
